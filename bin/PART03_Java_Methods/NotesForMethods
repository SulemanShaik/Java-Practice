        A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return
	    the result to the caller. A method can perform some specific task without 
		returning anything. Methods allow us to reuse the code without retyping 
	    the code. In Java, every method must be part of some class which is different 
	    from languages like C, C++, and Python.
	    Methods are time savers and help us to reuse the code without retyping the code.
	
	Modifier-: Defines access type of the method i.e.
	   from where it can be accessed in your application.
	    In Java, there 4 type of the access specifiers.
	public: accessible in all class in your application.
	protected: accessible within the class in which it is defined and in its subclass(es)
	private: accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
	default (declared/defined without using any modifier) : accessible within same class and package within which its class is defined.
	
	The return type : The data type of the value returned by the method or void if does not return a value.
	Method Name : the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.
	Parameter list : Comma separated list of the input parameters are defined, preceded with their data type, within the enclosed parenthesis. If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses ().
	Exception list : The exceptions you expect by the method can throw, you can specify these exception(s).
	Method body : it is enclosed between braces. The code you need to be executed to perform your intended operations.
