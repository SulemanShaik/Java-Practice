	Interview Question:
	
	java doesn't support Multiple inheritance 
	
	 Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes.
	 The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same method 
	 and you call it from child class object, there will be 
	  to call the method of A or B class.
	
	
	
	Example:
	--------
	class A{  
      void msg(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
       }  
         class B{  
       void msg(){System.out.println("Welcome");}  
          }  
        class C extends A,B{//suppose if it were  
   
         public static void main(String args[]){  
           C obj=new C();  
              obj.msg();//Now which msg() method would be invoked?  
}  
}
