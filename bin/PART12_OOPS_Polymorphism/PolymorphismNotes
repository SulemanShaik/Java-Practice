Polymorphism - Same name +multiple form
   (action/behavior)
   
   
   Types of Poly:
   
  1. Compile time  /early binding / static binding / overloading
  
     
     Same method name and different signature
     In same class we have multiple methods with same name but different method signature
     
  Interview Question:
  	
  	*can we achieve overloading by keeping the method signature same 
  	and changing the return type?
  	Ans:No
  
  
  
  
   
  2. Runtime time  /late binding / dynamic binding / overriding

  different classes (with inheritance applied) we have methods with same signature



  Interview Question:
  	
  	*can we return type while performing overriding?
  	
  	Ans:No - When the return type is primitive 
  	    yes - in case the return types are className

 early binding
 late binding
 static binding
 overloading
 overriding
